<h1> elasticall </h1>
Shell tool to query and monitor Elasticsearch

<h2> Motivation </h2>

I would like to be able to give such kind of high level commands from the shell: 

<ol>
<li> "Computer, tell me how many log lines entered Eleasticsearch in the last hour."
<li> "Computer, give me a random sample of log lines stored into Elasticsearch index lcslogs in the last month."
<li> "Computer, tell me how long the Elasticsearch has been running and how much heap space is available".
<li> "Computer, give me all log lines produced in the last hour containing the word 'error'."
</ol>

<p>
Commands [1,2,3,4] provide interesting output but there is more we can get than the sheer answer. Running `time` on command [2] is the best way I can figure out to measure the <b>search time performance</b> of Elasticsearch. Indeed, to take a random sample Elasticsearch is forced to visit all the sample-space each time. If you repeat two time the same command you should get similar response time.
</p>

<p>
Looking at command [4] <span class="cmd">elasticall</span> seems similar to a previously developed tool called [elastico](https://github.com/slac-lcls/elastico), which also runs Elasticsearch queries from the shell. <i>elastico</i> though is a tool customized to search into logs, that is, to search into our <i>lclslogs</i> index. Conversely, <i>elasticall</i> can run very general parametric queries and it is index agnostic. Respect to <i>elastico</i>, <i>elasticall</i> is more general, more powerfull and more difficult to use.
</p>

<p>
<span class="cmd">elasticall</span> was made to throw very complex queries to Elasticsearch and beutify the output results. As such, it is a tool that frees the user from the tedious interactions with JSON. Taking random sample is just anohter, not trivial, Elasticsearch query.
</p>

<p>
<span class="cmd">elasticall</span> calls always a <b>recipe script file</b>, the recipe file containes [1] the JSON command to send to Elasticsearch in a very readable format [2] preprocessing routines and [3] postprocessing routines. I give a few examples of script files below, using them as template it is not difficult to extend *elasticall* capabilities but adding new scripts. 
</p>

<p>
<span class="cmd">$> elasticall -h</span> provides a brief manual page. The provided script files available in directory *query* and are commented.
</p>

<h2> Installation & run</h2>

<p>
<b>CAVEAT</b> The procedure is tested working for **lclslogs** Elasticsearch index and for the program `elasticall` to be installed in *psmetric01*. Other users in other networks need to tweak some details, as the Elasticsearch URL, in the source code.
</p>

<ul>
<li>  Get the source from GitHub
<li>  Run the installation script: `$> sudo install`
<li>  Test run, shows the builtin manual: 

<div class="cmd">
$> elasticall -h
</div>

<li> Easy task, show the number all log lines stored into LCLS-logs index.

<div class="cmd withOutput">
$> elasticall --s0='*' /usr/local/etc/elasticall/paramSearchAndCount
</div>

<div class="output">
=> querys: '*', num.doc: 557,668,598
</div>
</ul>


<h2> Heads up ! </h2>

<p>
<b>CAVEAT for LCLS users.</b> Before you do any test you must be aware of this important fact. <span class="cmd">elasticall</span> runs in <b>psmetric01</b> but the Elasticsearch server runs in <b>psmetric04</b>. If you run a search that takes time and kill <span class="cmd">elasticall</span> before it ends, by e.g. <span class="cmd">Ctrl+C</span>, or <span class="cmd">kill</span>, the search will keep on running on <b>psmetric04</b>! 
</p>

<p>
If you intend to run multiple queries via <span class="cmd">elasticall</span> and kill them librerally then keep an eye on <b>psmetric04</b> load with <span class="cmd">top</span>. A CPU load of about <b>500%</b> in <span class="cmd">top</span> is expected when you run long and complex queries.
</p>

<h2> Random Sample to measure search performace </h2>

<p>
<b>Def.</b> What is called here **random sample** is a shortcut for 'random sample without replacement'. This is what I implemented.
</p>

<p>
A random sample, if well taken, implies that all the sample space must be visited at each run. It makes no sense to cache results. Also, if the sample space is large enough, it is impossible to cache it in RAM.
</p>

<p>
<b>CASE.1</b> Random sample without parameters, by default runs on all of Elasticsearch *lclslogs* index and returns 20 lines. 
</p>

<h2> Random Sample to detect anomalies  </h2>

<p>
The validity of the method proposed in this section relies on **one powerfull assumtion**: *when something starts to go wrong in a machine there will be a massive production of similar error messages*.
</p>

<p>
Sometimes the assumption may not hold, e.g. a machine may have the powersupply broken, there will not be any error log in this case, the machine will turn off. We disregard this kind of failures now.
</p>

<p>
The supposedly there is something wrong in our machines and a consequent massive production of error messages how could we spot the fact without too much technicalities? We just take a random sample, if we see repeated messages there is a good probability we have a problem.
</p>

<p>
Then, there are problem that are logstanding, we can not fix them in one day, so it is often usefull to compare our current random sample with an old one. 
</p>

<p>
Let's see an example. We start by taking a random sample of messages from the few last days. 
</p>

<div class="cmd withOutput">
$> time elasticall --s0=20 --s2='now-2d' --s3='now'\

<p>
We see the service *rpc.gssd* does not appear at all in the past. This must be a recent problem. 
</p>

<p>
Something persisting from the past instead is in machine *psrealay*, a *dhcpd* error message. It seems some computer is not getting an IP. 
</p>

<p>
The analysis is very crude but we can already establish with a good degree of confidence that we ***may have a problem in *psanagpu104****.

<h2> Counting log lines  </h2>

<p>

</p>

<p>
Let's count all logs in the last hour.
</p>

<div class="cmd withOutput">

<p>
Le't count all document in the last 24 hours matching the Lucene query "lustre AND (ana*)".
